# Getting Started

### How to run project without compiling and building
`$>gradlew clean -Dorg.gradle.java.home="pathtojdkhome"` -> cleans existing build files

`$>gradlew bootRun -Dorg.gradle.java.home="pathtojdkhome"` -> compiles, tests and run the project without preparing build/jar
 - here commandline argument needed to pass , which tells build tool to consider path of required jdk home and it must be equal to 'sourceCompatibility' property mentioned in build.gradle file, without this argument gradlew build will fail with **invalid source release** error
